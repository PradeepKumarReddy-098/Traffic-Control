# Traffic Control

Project Deployement Link (https://66e914ee8fa9749d7f543912--dynamic-starship-6f44b6.netlify.app/).

### Functionality

- The traffic lights follow a predefined sequence (e.g., green -> yellow -> red -> green).
- Pedestrians can request a crossing by pressing the pedestrian button.
- If a pedestrian request is made, the traffic light will transition to red after the current light cycle completes.
- Timers control the duration of each light state.

### Installation
- Clone the repository
- Navigate to the project directory  [example: cd my-app]

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
